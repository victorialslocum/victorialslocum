## 👋 Hi, I’m Victoria!  

I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a degree in linguistics and a passion for natural language processing. I became a bit obsessed with coding and Python after creating some NLP projects and have been growing my skills as a programmer since! 🌱  

I'm just starting my career as a Developer Advocate for Explosion 💥, the makers of spaCy! I'm doing cool things for our community, like example projects, videos, visuals, and posts, and learning lots.
