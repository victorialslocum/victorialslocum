## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victoria!  

I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a degree in linguistics and a passion for natural language processing. I became a bit obsessed with coding and Python after creating some NLP projects and have been growing my skills as a programmer since! ðŸŒ±  

I'm just starting my career as a Developer Advocate for Explosion ðŸ’¥, the makers of spaCy! I'm doing cool things for our community, like example projects, videos, visuals, and posts, and learning lots.  
 
ðŸ“« You can reach me at [my email](victoria@explosion.ai) or find more information on [my website](https://victoriaslocum.com)!
